<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Cambria",serif;color:black'>I chose
to analyze the </span><a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment"><span
style='font-family:"Cambria",serif;color:#1155CC'>Speed Dating Experiment</span></a><span
style='font-family:"Cambria",serif;color:black'> dataset from Kaggle and to
entitle our project, “Love at First Date”. The dataset gives a great deal of
information about the participants. This includes age, race, field of study,
school attended for undergrad, career, interests, income, and goals of
participating amongst many other factors. The study collected information
comparing the different pairings throughout the night. This includes how
satisfied participants were with the people they met, what attributes were most
important to them while rating, and how they thought they matched up compared
to other people. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Cambria",serif;color:black'>I am
interested in this topic because unconventional dating is becoming increasingly
popular in today’s society with the rise of applications such as Tinder, Coffee
Meets Bagel, Bumble and the increase in online dating sites such as EHarmony,
christianmingle.com, etc. Because of this, we are curious to see what
qualities/characteristics are most important when meeting someone for the first
time. Many people in these artificially set up dating environments have a checklist
they go through when meeting people on dating apps or in speed dating
situations. We are interested to see if such a “checklist” is apparent when
analyzing the people that were satisfied with the overall experience. </span></p>

Work</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Cambria",serif;color:black'>Before
deciding on visualizations, I looked at some of the work other people had done
with this dataset. People viewed it from multiple perspectives, such as
predicting yes or predicting overall satisfaction. I was most interested in
looking at overall satisfaction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Cambria",serif;color:black'>Cleaning
the Data</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Cambria",serif;color:black'>This
was a huge data set that required a great deal of work before beginning the
visualizations. I first began by eliminating variables that I did not find to
be of interest, whether they were redundant or I could not think of a
visualization involving that variable. On a couple of the speed dating rounds,
individuals were asked to use a different scoring scale. I also eliminated all
of these to avoid confusion and to save time manipulating these. I then deleted
variables and rows that had mostly missing data. These were not useful at all,
and I did this to further reduce the size. </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst><b>Evaluation: </b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>First looking at the descriptive
statistics, the most popular interests/hobbies among both men and women were
dining, music, and reading. Men were significantly more interested in gaming
and sports than women, while women were significantly more interested in
shopping than men. Men were slightly more optimistic about the people they
would meet, coming in higher for number of people they would be happy to meet,
number of people they thought would be interested in them, and the number of
mutual matches they expected to get.  Most people participated in the
experiment because they wanted a fun night out and to meet new people.  It was
somewhat important to both men and women that their prospective matches was of
the same race and religion as them. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>I then further analyzed what people wanted
in a match. The two most important attributes to men were attractiveness and
intelligence. Women thought men would place a very large importance on
attractiveness, much higher than the other attributes. While this was the
highest ranked attribute for men, it was not as overwhelmingly so as women
predicted. Perhaps men are not as shallow as women think after all! The three
most important attributes to women were intelligence, attractiveness, and
sincerity in decreasing order. They did more evenly distribute their points
among the attributes than men. I guess it’s true that women want it all and are
more difficult to please. Men thought women would place the most value on
attractiveness and fun. Men and women alike ranked themselves very highly in
all of the different attributes, and both ranked themselves highest for
sincerity and intelligence. It appears that this was a very confident group of
people, but I was not surprised by this. It definitely takes confidence to
participate in a speed dating experiment. I was also curious whether certain careers
attracted more “yesses”.  An overwhelming majority of the most popular men
worked in business. There was not this overwhelming majority for the most
popular women, and it was pretty evenly distributed. The most common career
fields of the popular women were social sciences/psychology, social work, and
education. I did not find either of these figures surprising. In the society
where the study was done men are expected to be the primary bread winner,
explaining the strong interest in business men. Women are thought of as more of
the caregivers, explaining the interest in women with less time demanding
careers.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast>People seem to have been decently satisfied
with the night ranging from the 5-6 range out of 10. However, many people have
been on dates and been in contact with their matches. While many people’s goal
of the night was to just have fun and meet new people, I was surprised by the
high number of people that have been on dates. Men have been on slightly more
dates than women, meaning men are going on dates with more than one of their
matches. This aligns with the fact that men have been calling their matches much
more than women. I was not surprised that a great deal of the records were one
sided matches. Even in more authentic dating situations, this seems to often be
the case. People’s perceptions of themselves did not vary much from before and
after this experiment. </p>
